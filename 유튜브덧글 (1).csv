BLACKPINK – ‘Lovesick Girls’

영원한 밤
창문 없는 방에 우릴 가둔 love
What can we say
매번 아파도 외치는 love

다치고 망가져도 나
뭘 믿고 버티는 거야
어차피 떠나면 상처투성인 채로 미워하게 될걸
끝장을 보기 전 끝낼 순 없어
이 아픔을 기다린 것처럼

아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까

But I don’t care I’ll do it over and over
내 세상 속엔 너만 있으면 돼

We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

But we were born to be alone
Yeah we were born to be alone
Yeah we were born to be alone 
But why we still looking for love

No love letters, no x and o’s
No love never, my exes know
No diamond rings, that set in stone
To the left, better left alone

Didn’t wanna be a princess, I’m priceless
A prince not even on my list
Love is a drug that I quit
No doctor could help when I’m lovesick

아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까

불안한 내 눈빛 속에 널 담아
아프더라도 너만 있으면 돼

We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

But we were born to be alone
Yeah we were born to be alone
Yeah we were born to be alone 
But why we still looking for love

사랑은 slippin’ and fallin’
사랑은 killin’ your darlin’
아프다 아물면 또 찾아오는 이 겁 없는 떨림

들리지 않아 what you say
이 아픔이 난 행복해
나를 불쌍해 하는 네가 내 눈엔 더 불쌍해

We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

Lovesick girls 
모두 결국 떠나가고
Lovesick girls
내 눈물이 무뎌져도
Lovesick girls
아프고 또 아파도
Lovesick girls
But we’re still looking for love

Let's appreciate their music since some teumes' using As if it's your last, love sick girls, ice cream and how you like that as an interval when their str34ming. By the way I'm Blink and teume too. For sure they'll appreciate that if we participate right? I'm not saying this just because I'm a teume but I am saying this becasue I'll support both group since I'm Blink since boombayah era.

i am not even a blink, but this song just hit differently. maybe because i am heartbroken after a relationship that was so important to me, but every time i hear this song i just start crying. especially on Rose's parts. she is so emotionally expressive with her voice here.

Blackpink just released so many songs at once, so other people also listen to the other songs which might be the reason why the view for Lovesick is much lower than usual. But that’s okay, as long as we all enjoy all of their songs then it’s okay! Don’t forget to listen on Spotify and Apple Music!

There's nothing wrong with the outfit, the problem is with the person who saw malice in Jennie's scene.  And another, the solution to harassment is not to want to change the clothes that nurses wear, but to punish those who have this type of attitude towards them.

We did great BLINKS! don't feel bad 'cuz if youtube is really not clowning us and this is really our total views, then the amount of dislikes must be legit too. And that is the least number of dislike that BLACKPINK have ever had in all of their MV's. And that just means that it's good that haters can't dislike it too. And remember, the pinks said they make music to make the fans feel good by listening to good music. It's not always about who has more views. It's about enjoying the album. And to think, that people are watching and enjoying the other tracks too , which might be the reason why this is not getting more views, means THE ALBUM is successful as a whole. This is our first time having 8 songs in an album so it must feel pretty overwhelming for us to listen to all the songs. So don't worry BLINKS! We are doing well! Remember this is already our third MV! And we pretty much killed it!

There's nothing sexualizing about jennie's outfit, those who think so are the ones that need to be cancelled. Yg has had so many scandals because of media play and they are trying their best not to have any more scandals and protect their artists the best as they can. Yg and yg artists have always been the target of scandals though time and time again these accusations have always been proven wrong because those are just baseless rumors; and knets can't even appreciate the powerful korean ethnicity and culture they expose to millions of foreign fans.

Jennie's scene is not sexual, please stop talking nonsense. She and the other girls worked so hard on this and people are just judging, it's really sad.

Blink, leave positive messages on all members' Instagram accounts, show haters that we are stronger!

The scene with Jennie as the Therapist and Jennie as her own patient is really powerful because most of the times the only one that can help you is yourself and people would never understand what your going through as much as you do。When Jennie said “no doctor can fix you when your lovesick” meaning in two ways, that no one can help you when your relationship with someone you love deeply has fallen apart, and can also mean that “no one can help you as much as yourself, no one can understand the problems that you face as much as you do and the only way to fix it, is your own self”。That’s why there’s a line in the song “We were born to be alone” meaning that when we are alone, we can fix ourselves better because you know yourself better than anyone else and that even though we don’t need a relationship cause it’s better being alone, they still have an urge for desperately looking for love。By the way my mother is a nurse but she is also a therapist as well, so it is a powerful scene and message!

There was nothing wrong with the Jennie nurse drama, and to think that rapper Jennie is back calls for support. Please no hate to any of the girls, they work so hard.
I respect SK opinion and the scene will probably be edited, but Blinks are just expressing their thoughts.

Can you guys stop commenting : “no one literally no one: everyone : comments this and gets nothing of likes"". It's getting seriously annoying, it's disrespectful, they worked hard in this and did an amazing job. 

Instead, let's fill the comment section with positive comments for Blackpink. You guys worked hard and it shows, so proud of you all, I hope we can repay you by breaking the record. You deserve all the love in the world but the world doesn't deserve you. Keep going at them haters harder and harder. Love you beautiful angels. Copy this message and fill it in the comment section. Let’s go Blinks!

This song is just so wonderful and inspirational. The lyrics are meaningful and surprisingly, I'm not even disappointed. Jisoo got the lines she deserved and same goes to Rosé since she is our main vocal and jisoo is our lead vocal. Jennie gets to rap but only a little not like jer rap in D3 but still I'm not that disappointed as before. But it doesn't matter if jennie doesn't have a rap line and jisoo not getting much lines but as long as our girls worked hard for this, let us support them until the end. Love you blackpink!

If you find Jennies nurse outfit sexual.... then you need urgent help. 
JENNIE ISN’T THE PROBLEM. YOUR DIRTY MINDS AND JEALOUSY ARE THE PROBLEM. THERE ARE SO MANY GGs WHO WORE WAY SEXIER NURSE OUTFITS BUT SUDDENLY IT BECOMES A PROBLEM WHEN JENNIE WEARS IT?! You’ve got to be kidding me. It’s a normal, knee length dress I don’t get what the problem is.

Jennie wearing the nurse outfit isn't even sexualizing anyone. She just wore it normally sitting there and spitting fires with her rap. If you understand the meaning and the point of the song you won't look at it as sexualizing. And It's not her fault she is born sexy and hot for just wearing a anything. The fault here is that this people's mind are so perverted that they are sexualizing her in anything she wears. Respect Jennie. Respect nurses. Respect women!

Jennie's nurse outfit isn't even the problem. The people with perverted minds are. The skirt was barley even 1 inch above her knees, and her shirt covered her upper body. It's extremely upsetting to see how women are sexualized for everything we wear, but when a guy is fully naked in a mv, it's so hot. The double standards are ridiculous and it shows. Jennie is the one who's the victim here. It's not her fault that she was born sexy, that she was born beautiful. She's a role model to all female blinks, you really think that she will wear something offensive towards people? Those men and women have perverted minds and they need serious help. YG defend Jennie for once in your life. This is getting ridiculous. These poor girls can't even breathe anymore.

Actually , jennie's outfit isn't even sexy, it's a knee-length skirt , and not even a tight outfit.

For those of you who don't know what is happening, netizens (most korean) are hating on jennie's scene because she is ""sexualizing"" the doctor role when clearly, she is not wearing any revealing or short clothing.

theory: jisoo was the only one without a boy in this mv. and she was running in the second prechorus. maybe she was running to save her friends from betrayal of their lovers? we saw in the first prechorus thats she was holding an hourglass in the beginning and it was broken. i think it meant that the time is passing by and the girls' betrayal time is close. the girls kept a promise of not falling in love in PWF and KTL and jisoo is feeling betrayed because her members broke the promise. when jisoo sang these lyrics in the prechorus ""maybe it's all just for a moment. what are we looking for so aimlessly?"" she was in a garden and was calm and then Rosé said ""but i dont care i do it over and over"" maybe meant that rosé broke the promise and didnt care for her friendship with the members but instead for her love with the boy. We see that Lisa is the only one not crying. she put her head on the shoulder of the boy and then she was standing alone. it was because she was imagining how it felt to be in love. she wanted to experience it but because of the promise with her friends, she didn't. we then see that jennie kicked the guy out of the car and was in the hospital. maybe she saw that guy cheating on her with rosé. that's the same guy lisa was imagining about. so maybe lisa has a crush on the boy. we saw that jennie was in the hospital. she maybe had an anxiety disorder and maybe wrongly accused the boy for cheating. in pwf mv, Jennie ran away with the boy on a bike. in this mv we see that they were now in the car. their relationship had upgraded but at that moment she realised that the guy is a bad person. then we see that rosé was crying alone. in the pwf mv, we saw that she was holding a book and was the only one who got to hug the boy. she also wore a pink furry offshoulder shirt in the mv but maybe it's a coincidence since she is painting pink on the walls. then when she was crying, she painted black which was the boy's hair colour. she maybe did that to remember the boy. but that black and pink paint could also mean her group's name ""BLACKPINK"" so maybe she also did that because she felt guilty towards the girls. we also saw that in the whistle mv, she was sitting alone on the Earth planet. maybe it meant that she was lonely and had no one to comfort her? so maybe that's why she was crying in this mv because the boy left her alone and she was lonely again. then back to jisoo, she came back in the right time and saved her members from falling into love and they continued their friendship.

너무 신나는 멜로디인데 가사는 뭔가 너무 슬프다..사람한테 많이 상처받고 나서 사람을 너무 사랑하게 되면 이런 생각이 들던데..설레는 동시에 두렵고 아파할 걸 알면서도 사랑하고 싶고..원래 k-pop그렇게 좋아하진 않는데 이 곡은 매일 매일 들음..

Can you guys stop commenting : “no one literally no one: everyone : comments this and gets nothing of likes"". It's getting seriously annoying, it's disrespectful, they worked hard in this and did an amazing job. 

Instead, let's fill the comment section with positive comments for Blackpink. You guys worked hard and it shows, so proud of you all, I hope we can repay you by breaking the record. You deserve all the love in the world but the world doesn't deserve you. Keep going at them haters harder and harder. Love you beautiful angels. Copy this message and fill it in the comment section. Let’s go Blinks! Copy and Paste this so hater's see this!

What I can appreciate is that BlackPink is not pandering to the “trend” machine. They’re making music that they want. This is what it means to be artists. Also, true BLINKs support no matter what the genre, the “line distribution”, whatever else.

Lovesick Girls is probably the best title track of blackpink so far. And two members were credited for the first time. It’s unfortunate that some stans feels vengeance due to what happened to Ice Cream which is arguably one of the worst bp songs. The toxicity of bp fandom is really on another level. I hope it can still be salvaged. The girls deserve better fandom. Good thing, general public has their backs and would always appreciate blackpink’s music a lot.

We don't want Jennie's scene removed, she worked hard filming it and her wardrobe is not revealing or provocative, some Koreans have to understand that idols are not perfect and no one is perfect, stop attacking Jennie just because they feel like it.

 She has worked very hard and deserves everything she has achieved, aside from what she is blamed for, there is already evidence that nothing was what it seemed so stop bothering her. We love her

The only problem that exists here are the people who are sexualizing a woman for simply existing. The outfit and the behavior of Jennie in her ""love doctor"" scene does not have any sexual innuendos or sexual energy. Its very innocent and serves to represent the lyrics she is singing, none of which are sexual. If you want to combat the sexualization of nurses, blaming jennie and demanding YG to delete the scene is NOT the way to do it. The only thing that does is validate the idea that female nurses are inherently sexual in nature and therefore reinforces the very ideas that these people are so against.

What i am excited to see and look forward to see from these girls is a ballad that is just written so nicely, hitting incredible notes and hits us all in the heart like it's the end of us. Please make a ballad.

Listen out people the jennie scene has nothing sexual ok....jennie had her collars up and she was fully covered in clothes . She didnt do any sexy move in that outfit. You can just make jennie wear a trash bag my baby will still slay and look hot...so stop hating her cause this issue is very stupid. My sister is herself a nurse and my parents are doctors and they are our saviours in this pandemic but in no way that scene looked disrespectful. I dont want yg to delete that scene...

jennie doesn't deserve this. there's nothing wrong with her outfit, she didn't do anything inappropriate. other groups also wore nurses and doctors outfits but no one said anything about it. everything is suddenly a big deal when blackpink does it and it sucks. it's so unfair how she was the one that was sexualized but she's being asked to adjust and ended up receiving hate for something that she didn't do. she's just literally sitting and writing, if you see something wrong abt her scene then your mindset is the problem. y'all should stop having double standards and using blackpink as your punching bags.

Can you guys stop commenting : “no one literally no one: everyone : comments this and gets nothing of likes"". It's getting seriously annoying, it's disrespectful, they worked hard in this and did an amazing job. 
Instead, let's fill the comment section with positive comments for Blackpink. You guys worked hard and it shows, so proud of you all, I hope we can repay you by breaking the record. You deserve all the love in the world but the world doesn't deserve you. Keep going at them haters harder and harder. Love you beautiful angels

Guys, something very fishy is going on here.
There's no way that it has only 54M views so far, the likes and dislikes are not balanced either.
I commented very early (30mins after the premiere) on the video and now my comment is nowhere to be found,it was at 600+ likes and it was not even close to spam,it was a genuine compliment.

I'm sick and tired of people sexualizing jennie and the other blackpink members. Like there is NOTHING wrong with Jennie's nurse outfit. She didnt even do anything sexual!!!! I dont see why people have to sexualize anything they can find on blackpink! Jennie looks amazing!! It did not mean any disrespect towards the nurses or doctors. I really dont want yg to delete the nurse scene because that was my second favorite scene in the music video and because Jennie was really happy while making that scene. I told my great grandma (she is a nurse) and I told her about the controversy about jennies nurse outfit. She said something on the lines like this, 'She looks pretty in that nurse outfit, I cant see how this is disrespectful to nurses and doctors. I dont see why people these days look for attention or to start trauma.' I didnt remember exactly what she said but I know she said something like that. We need to try and stop yg from deleting the nurse scene!! Blinks we can and will do it!!!

2,"BLACKPINK – ‘Lovesick Girls’

영원한 밤
창문 없는 방에 우릴 가둔 love
What can we say
매번 아파도 외치는 love

다치고 망가져도 나
뭘 믿고 버티는 거야
어차피 떠나면 상처투성인 채로 미워하게 될걸
끝장을 보기 전 끝낼 순 없어
이 아픔을 기다린 것처럼

아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까

But I don’t care I’ll do it over and over
내 세상 속엔 너만 있으면 돼

We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

But we were born to be alone
Yeah we were born to be alone
Yeah we were born to be alone 
But why we still looking for love

No love letters, no x and o’s
No love never, my exes know
No diamond rings, that set in stone
To the left, better left alone

Didn’t wanna be a princess, I’m priceless
A prince not even on my list
Love is a drug that I quit
No doctor could help when I’m lovesick

아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까

불안한 내 눈빛 속에 널 담아
아프더라도 너만 있으면 돼

We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

But we were born to be alone
Yeah we were born to be alone
Yeah we were born to be alone 
But why we still looking for love

사랑은 slippin’ and fallin’
사랑은 killin’ your darlin’
아프다 아물면 또 찾아오는 이 겁 없는 떨림

들리지 않아 what you say
이 아픔이 난 행복해
나를 불쌍해 하는 네가 내 눈엔 더 불쌍해

We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

Lovesick girls 
모두 결국 떠나가고
Lovesick girls
내 눈물이 무뎌져도
Lovesick girls
아프고 또 아파도
Lovesick girls
But we’re still looking for love

317,"I'm not BlackPink fans but I'm tearing up because of  Jennie, She's human and she work hard to be Idol/to achieve her dream, haters  don't know how hard for her,and they did to her, 

Every Idols deserves respect (Even though if you are not fans) Every human deserves respect......"
318,I can't believe that people are actually saying Jennie's nurse scene is sexual- people need to get their minds straight honestly like wtf. People hate seeing powerful women like Jennie and it's starting to show smhh
319,"If you ever feel stupid, just remember that blackpink's antis exist."
320,"Jennie, Lisa, Rose : with the guy
Jisoo in a running condition : im here to save you guys!"
321,"I'm not even a Blink but this hate to Jennie is so so much. This talented, cute girl has never deserved this kind of attitude. Please, Jennie stay strong. Be sure that even other fandoms everytime support you. You're so precious for us and you're one of the strong idol in this Kpop industry. We love you so much💜"
322,LOVE
323,"Who's proud of Producer Jennie and

Jensoo Lyricist??

324,JENNIE don't worry this is not your fault.. You didn't do anything wrong babe and just IGNORE all the HATERS
325,"4 vocalist, 4 rappers, 4 dancers, 4 actresses, 4 visuals. Yeah that's Blackpink"
326,"From this song, we learn that a girl doesn't need a boyfriend to be happy. And for girls that have been hurt, you're nothing without that pain, because of that pain you've become a strong woman. But don't stop to find a boy that is perfect for you, loveyou blinkeu!"

330,"Lisa: With a guy

Jennie: With a guy

Rose: With a guy

I'm Jisoo I'm OK"
331,All the dislikes are from those doctors who can't help Jennie when she's lovesick
332,"The Album is basically about them.
•How you like that is about their success and karma hitting haters
•Lovesick Girls is about freedom and not giving up hope (explained by Lyricist Jensoo)
•Pretty Savage is a diss to haters"
333,"Blinks: Why is Rosé crying?
Rosé: He brought the wrong type of pink;-;

Edit: OML THIS WAS 2 WEEKS AGO IM LITERALLY CRYING RN THANKS SO MUCH FOR 1,2k LIKES OMFG<33"
334,"rosé: with a guy
lisa: with a guy
jennie: with a guy"
335,There is nothing wrong about Jennie's scene. And more importantly there is nothing wrong with Jennie. The costume is okay. Nothing is revealing!! C'mon. The minds of the people who think that there is something about it are the ones who needs help.
336,"We did great BLINKS! don't feel bad 'cuz if youtube is really not clowning us and this is really our total views, then the amount of dislikes must be legit too. And that is the least number of dislike that BLACKPINK have ever had in all of their MV's. And that just means that it's good that haters can't dislike it too. And remember, the pinks said they make music to make the fans feel good by listening to good music. It's not always about who has more views. It's about enjoying the album. And to think, that people are watching and enjoying the other tracks too , which might be the reason why this is not getting more views, means THE ALBUM is successful as a whole. This is our first time having 8 songs in an album so it must feel pretty overwhelming for us to listen to all the songs. So don't worry BLINKS! We are doing well! Remember this is already our third MV! And we pretty much killed it!"
337,"Protect our girls, especially Jennie and Lisa. They get so much hate."
338,"Popular opinion: JENNIE IS NOT THE PROBLEM, HATERS ARE."
339,once again BLACKPINK proved they NEVER disappoint
340,"There's nothing sexualizing about jennie's outfit, those who think so are the ones that need to be cancelled. Yg has had so many scandals because of media play and they are trying their best not to have any more scandals and protect their artists the best as they can. Yg and yg artists have always been the target of scandals though time and time again these accusations have always been proven wrong because those are just baseless rumors; and knets can't even appreciate the powerful korean ethnicity and culture they expose to millions of foreign fans. Like why are.they.always.trying.to.bring.down.yg?"
341,"In this era:
1. Jisoo finally says ""blackpink in your area"" in ""Pretty Savage""
2. Jennie gets rap lines
3. Rosé gets a lot of screen time"
342,"This is not JISOO's era 
This is not JENNIE's era
This is not ROSE's era 
This is not LISA's era "
343,"Jennie: ""With a Guy""
Rosé: ""With a Guy""
Lisa: ""With a Guy""
Jisoo: ""I'm Jisoo, I'm Okay"""
344,"Jennie was so happy to play double role in that nurse scene and now because of haters yg will delete it... Do you even know how much time and energy she had to spend... You don't cuz you just staying at home, sleeping and spreading hate"
345,"Popular opinion: Jennie is not the problem haters are
Mommy I am famous now
 (3k👍) thanks for the likes"
346,The fact that YG listened to us for once is pretty nice. The Album is seriously THE revolution and I can’t wait to see them perform new songs
347,"Jennie is NOT the problem
Keep this in mind haters when u hate

-Kurdish BLINK"
348,"hey blinks, just want to remind u that the only reason why lovesick girls didn’t perform as well is because 2020 is full of comebacks....but tell me from the bottom of your heart, are you the happiest blink this year with lots of content? is blackpink happy?

356,"Attention, possibly someone ready for love filter on my channel I got the song distorted, so as not to bring problems, at the moment I am the only person to have it, I clarify, I do not think it is the real 😨"
357,"In this era:

358,This song gives me chills😳😳

360,"okay,is nobody talking about jisso (again) so , did she is the least loved member by the fans ? (question) just wanna leave blink"
361,"In 1 word..

362,"The MV with Jennie's nurse scene is better than now... TT However, I will always support all of you, girls^^ I just need your songs and don't care what people say about you. 5ting girls!
P/s: Hoping Rosé's pain will be healed."
363,My daughter love blackpink so much. She always tell me everything about blackpink. Today is her birthday. I think this song is a birthday gift for her from blackpink.
364,this is the type of music you will play while crying but smiling at the same time after a heartbreak

Jennie is not the problem the haters are.☹️"
412,Jennie is being attacked not because she did something wrong but because she is Jennie. YG you can cut the scene from the video but you have to protect Jennie too please
413,popular opinion: jennie is not the problem haters are.
414,YESSSS this album is a bop
415,"Jennie deserves better. She was so excited to play the 2 roles because it fits her line perfectly, and now it's edited out. The real problem here are 1. Haters and 2. YG (for not defending Jennie)."
416,Popular opinion: It's not Jennie's fault the only problem is the dirty minds of HATERS and KOREAN FEMINISTS
417,"""WE WERE BORN TO BE ALONE""
No honey, you have BLINKS"
418,"Blackpink: ""we are still looking for love""

419,"Jennie's scene is not sexual, please stop talking nonsense. She and the other girls worked so hard on this and people are just judging, it's really sad.

Blink, leave positive messages on all members' Instagram accounts, show haters that we are stronger!"
420,THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH JENNIE’S SCENE HATERS ARE THE PROBLEM PERIODT.
421,"The scene with Jennie as the Therapist and Jennie as her own patient is really powerful because most of the times the only one that can help you is yourself and people would never understand what your going through as much as you do。When Jennie said “no doctor can fix you when your lovesick” meaning in two ways, that no one can help you when your relationship with someone you love deeply has fallen apart, and can also mean that “no one can help you as much as yourself, no one can understand the problems that you face as much as you do and the only way to fix it, is your own self”。That’s why there’s a line in the song “We were born to be alone” meaning that when we are alone, we can fix ourselves better because you know yourself better than anyone else and that even though we don’t need a relationship cause it’s better being alone, they still have an urge for desperately looking for love。By the way my mother is a nurse but she is also a therapist as well, so it is a powerful scene and message!"
422,"Rosé : with a boy
Lisa : with a boy 
Jennie : with a boy
Jisoo : I'm Jisoo I'm ok"
423,"There was nothing wrong with the Jennie nurse drama, and to think that rapper Jennie is back calls for support. Please no hate to any of the girls, they work so hard.
I respect SK opinion and the scene will probably be edited, but Blinks are just expressing their thoughts."
424,Popular opinion: Jennie is not the problem haters are.
425,"""Jennie's nurse scene it's not sexualising nurses, people are sexualising jennie, It's disrespectful and gross to think of something sexual in that scene, cause it isn't insinuating something sexual, neither the scene, neither the lyrics, Jennie's not sexualising anything, you're just perverts"""
426,"Don't be sad about the views remember that views don't determine whether the group is good  or bad, the the only thing that matters is that the girls are happy i mean look at them they made an album and 3 mv's."
427,"“But we’re still looking for love.” 

this line made me cry i swear"

429,"The fact that finally I can experience a blackpink comeback in peace without seeing blinks fighting with each other, we're a big family which needs to make our girls happy and proud"
430,Its horrible how YG has to delete the nurse scenes. Kpop idols wear school uniforms for a concept and no one complains but when Jennie wears a nurse outfit everyones attacking them..
431,"“I’m priceless, a prince not even on my list” -Jennie Kim 2020"
432,"Yg should not delete Jennie‘s nurse outfit scenes
She didn’t wrong she just wore a nurse outfit. They keep sexualising Jennie’s outfit bcs of their problem not bcs of our Jennie

523,"This song is just so wonderful and inspirational. The lyrics are meaningful and surprisingly, I'm not even disappointed. Jisoo got the lines she deserved and same goes to Rosé since she is our main vocal and jisoo is our lead vocal. Jennie gets to rap but only a little not like jer rap in D3 but still I'm not that disappointed as before. But it doesn't matter if jennie doesn't have a rap line and jisoo not getting much lines but as long as our girls worked hard for this, let us support them until the end. Love you blackpink!"

610,I LOVE this and the fact that Jisso and Jennie wrote parts of the song makes me feel proudness of them they have come so far. CONGRATS BLACKPINK! WE LOVE YOU! XOXO
611,Jennie wearing the nurse outfit isn't even sexualizing anyone. She just wore it normally sitting there and spitting fires with her rap. If you understand the meaning and the point of the song you won't look at it as sexualizing. And It's not her fault she is born sexy and hot for just wearing a anything. The fault here is that this people's mind are so perverted that they are sexualizing her in anything she wears. Respect Jennie. Respect nurses. Respect women!
612,Love BLACKPINK ❤️
613,Cuantos latinos por aquí espero no ser el único grande Blackpink
614,"Popular opinion:Jennie is not the problem,haters are"
615,Am I'm the one who LOVEs Jennie's Nurse Part?
616,"Jennie's nurse outfit isn't even the problem. The people with perverted minds are. The skirt was barley even 1 inch above her knees, and her shirt covered her upper body. It's extremely upsetting to see how women are sexualized for everything we wear, but when a guy is fully naked in a mv, it's so hot. The double standards are ridiculous and it shows. Jennie is the one who's the victim here. It's not her fault that she was born sexy, that she was born beautiful. She's a role model to all female blinks, you really think that she will wear something offensive towards people? Those men and women have perverted minds and they need serious help. YG defend Jennie for once in your life. This is getting ridiculous. These poor girls can't even breathe anymore."
617,Wonderful voice + Wonderful song = beautiful🖤

884,Best girl group in the world
885,"theory: jisoo was the only one without a boy in this mv. and she was running in the second prechorus. maybe she was running to save her friends from betrayal of their lovers? we saw in the first prechorus thats she was holding an hourglass in the beginning and it was broken. i think it meant that the time is passing by and the girls' betrayal time is close. the girls kept a promise of not falling in love in PWF and KTL and jisoo is feeling betrayed because her members broke the promise. when jisoo sang these lyrics in the prechorus ""maybe it's all just for a moment. what are we looking for so aimlessly?"" she was in a garden and was calm and then Rosé said ""but i dont care i do it over and over"" maybe meant that rosé broke the promise and didnt care for her friendship with the members but instead for her love with the boy. We see that Lisa is the only one not crying. she put her head on the shoulder of the boy and then she was standing alone. it was because she was imagining how it felt to be in love. she wanted to experience it but because of the promise with her friends, she didn't. we then see that jennie kicked the guy out of the car and was in the hospital. maybe she saw that guy cheating on her with rosé. that's the same guy lisa was imagining about. so maybe lisa has a crush on the boy. we saw that jennie was in the hospital. she maybe had an anxiety disorder and maybe wrongly accused the boy for cheating. in pwf mv, Jennie ran away with the boy on a bike. in this mv we see that they were now in the car. their relationship had upgraded but at that moment she realised that the guy is a bad person. then we see that rosé was crying alone. in the pwf mv, we saw that she was holding a book and was the only one who got to hug the boy. she also wore a pink furry offshoulder shirt in the mv but maybe it's a coincidence since she is painting pink on the walls. then when she was crying, she painted black which was the boy's hair colour. she maybe did that to remember the boy. but that black and pink paint could also mean her group's name ""BLACKPINK"" so maybe she also did that because she felt guilty towards the girls. we also saw that in the whistle mv, she was sitting alone on the Earth planet. maybe it meant that she was lonely and had no one to comfort her? so maybe that's why she was crying in this mv because the boy left her alone and she was lonely again. then back to jisoo, she came back in the right time and saved her members from falling into love and they continued their friendship."
886,"no diamond rings, that set in stone"

It’s unfortunate that some stans feels vengeance due to what happened to Ice Cream which is arguably one of the worst bp songs. The toxicity of bp fandom is really on another level.

1144,"The only problem that exists here are the people who are sexualizing a woman for simply existing. The outfit and the behavior of Jennie in her ""love doctor"" scene does not have any sexual innuendos or sexual energy. Its very innocent and serves to represent the lyrics she is singing, none of which are sexual. If you want to combat the sexualization of nurses, blaming jennie and demanding YG to delete the scene is NOT the way to do it. The only thing that does is validate the idea that female nurses are inherently sexual in nature and therefore reinforces the very ideas that these people are so against."

1268,Listen out people the jennie scene has nothing sexual ok....jennie had her collars up and she was fully covered in clothes . She didnt do any sexy move in that outfit. You can just make jennie wear a trash bag my baby will still slay and look hot...so stop hating her cause this issue is very stupid. My sister is herself a nurse and my parents are doctors and they are our saviours in this pandemic but in no way that scene looked disrespectful. I dont want yg to delete that scene...

1277,"jennie doesn't deserve this. there's nothing wrong with her outfit, she didn't do anything inappropriate. other groups also wore nurses and doctors outfits but no one said anything about it. everything is suddenly a big deal when blackpink does it and it sucks. it's so unfair how she was the one that was sexualized but she's being asked to adjust and ended up receiving hate for something that she didn't do. she's just literally sitting and writing, if you see something wrong abt her scene then your mindset is the problem. y'all should stop having double standards and using blackpink as your punching bags."

1519,"I'm sick and tired of people sexualizing jennie and the other blackpink members. Like there is NOTHING wrong with Jennie's nurse outfit. She didnt even do anything sexual!!!! I dont see why people have to sexualize anything they can find on blackpink! Jennie looks amazing!! It did not mean any disrespect towards the nurses or doctors. I really dont want yg to delete the nurse scene because that was my second favorite scene in the music video and because Jennie was really happy while making that scene. I told my great grandma (she is a nurse) and I told her about the controversy about jennies nurse outfit. She said something on the lines like this, 'She looks pretty in that nurse outfit, I cant see how this is disrespectful to nurses and doctors. I dont see why people these days look for attention or to start trauma.' I didnt remember exactly what she said but I know she said something like that. We need to try and stop yg from deleting the nurse scene!! Blinks we can and will do it!!!"
